        <a name="10"></a><b>Part 1</b>
        <br><br>
        <a name="11"></a>When the objects of an inquiry, in any department, have principles, conditions,
        <a name="12"></a>or elements, it is through acquaintance with these that knowledge, that
        <a name="13"></a>is to say scientific knowledge, is attained. For we do not think that we
        <a name="14"></a>know a thing until we are acquainted with its primary conditions or first
        <a name="15"></a>principles, and have carried our analysis as far as its simplest elements.
        <a name="16"></a>Plainly therefore in the science of Nature, as in other branches of study,
        <a name="17"></a>our first task will be to try to determine what relates to its
        <a name="18"></a>principles.
        <a name="19"></a><br><br>The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which
        <a name="20"></a>are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are
        <a name="21"></a>clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things are not 'knowable
        <a name="22"></a>relatively to us' and 'knowable' without qualification. So in the present
        <a name="23"></a>inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is more obscure
        <a name="24"></a>by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable
        <a name="25"></a>by nature.
        <a name="26"></a><br><br>Now what is to us plain and obvious at first is rather confused
        <a name="27"></a>masses, the elements and principles of which become known to us later by
        <a name="28"></a>analysis. Thus we must advance from generalities to particulars; for it
        <a name="29"></a>is a whole that is best known to sense-perception, and a generality is
        <a name="30"></a>a kind of whole, comprehending many things within it, like parts. Much
        <a name="31"></a>the same thing happens in the relation of the name to the formula. A name,
        <a name="32"></a>e.g. 'round', means vaguely a sort of whole: its definition analyses this
        <a name="33"></a>into its particular senses. Similarly a child begins by calling all men
        <a name="34"></a>'father', and all women 'mother', but later on distinguishes each of
        <a name="35"></a>them.
        <br><br>
        <a name="36"></a><b>Part 2</b>

        <a name="37"></a><br><br>The principles in question must be either (a) one or (b) more than
        <a name="38"></a>one. If (a) one, it must be either (i) motionless, as Parmenides and Melissus
        <a name="39"></a>assert, or (ii) in motion, as the physicists hold, some declaring air to
        <a name="40"></a>be the first principle, others water. If (b) more than one, then either
        <a name="41"></a>(i) a finite or (ii) an infinite plurality. If (i) finite (but more than
        <a name="42"></a>one), then either two or three or four or some other number. If (ii) infinite,
        <a name="43"></a>then either as Democritus believed one in kind, but differing in shape
        <a name="44"></a>or form; or different in kind and even contrary.
        <a name="45"></a><br><br>A similar inquiry is made by those who inquire into the number
        <a name="46"></a>of existents: for they inquire whether the ultimate constituents of existing
        <a name="47"></a>things are one or many, and if many, whether a finite or an infinite plurality.
        <a name="48"></a>So they too are inquiring whether the principle or element is one or
        <a name="49"></a>many.
        <a name="50"></a><br><br>Now to investigate whether Being is one and motionless is not a
        <a name="51"></a>contribution to the science of Nature. For just as the geometer has nothing
        <a name="52"></a>more to say to one who denies the principles of his science-this being
        <a name="53"></a>a question for a different science or for or common to all-so a man investigating
        <a name="54"></a>principles cannot argue with one who denies their existence. For if Being
        <a name="55"></a>is just one, and one in the way mentioned, there is a principle no longer,
        <a name="56"></a>since a principle must be the principle of some thing or
        <a name="57"></a>things.
        <a name="58"></a><br><br>To inquire therefore whether Being is one in this sense would be
        <a name="59"></a>like arguing against any other position maintained for the sake of argument
        <a name="60"></a>(such as the Heraclitean thesis, or such a thesis as that Being is one
        <a name="61"></a>man) or like refuting a merely contentious argument-a description which
        <a name="62"></a>applies to the arguments both of Melissus and of Parmenides: their premisses
        <a name="63"></a>are false and their conclusions do not follow. Or rather the argument of
        <a name="64"></a>Melissus is gross and palpable and offers no difficulty at all: accept
        <a name="65"></a>one ridiculous proposition and the rest follows-a simple enough
        <a name="66"></a>proceeding.
        <a name="67"></a><br><br>We physicists, on the other hand, must take for granted that the
        <a name="68"></a>things that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in motion
        <a name="69"></a>which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover, no man of science is
        <a name="70"></a>bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be raised, but only as
        <a name="71"></a>many as are drawn falsely from the principles of the science: it is not
        <a name="72"></a>our business to refute those that do not arise in this way: just as it
        <a name="73"></a>is the duty of the geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means
        <a name="74"></a>of segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon's proof. At the
        <a name="75"></a>same time the holders of the theory of which we are speaking do incidentally
        <a name="76"></a>raise physical questions, though Nature is not their subject: so it will
        <a name="77"></a>perhaps be as well to spend a few words on them, especially as the inquiry
        <a name="78"></a>is not without scientific interest.
        <a name="79"></a><br><br>The most pertinent question with which to begin will be this: In
        <a name="80"></a>what sense is it asserted that all things are one? For 'is' is used in
        <a name="81"></a>many senses. Do they mean that all things 'are' substance or quantities
        <a name="82"></a>or qualities? And, further, are all things one substance-one man, one horse,
        <a name="83"></a>or one soul-or quality and that one and the same-white or hot or something
        <a name="84"></a>of the kind? These are all very different doctrines and all impossible
        <a name="85"></a>to maintain.
        <a name="86"></a><br><br>For if both substance and quantity and quality are, then, whether
        <a name="87"></a>these exist independently of each other or not, Being will be
        <a name="88"></a>many.
        <a name="89"></a><br><br>If on the other hand it is asserted that all things are quality
        <a name="90"></a>or quantity, then, whether substance exists or not, an absurdity results,
        <a name="91"></a>if the impossible can properly be called absurd. For none of the others
        <a name="92"></a>can exist independently: substance alone is independent: for everything
        <a name="93"></a>is predicated of substance as subject. Now Melissus says that Being is
        <a name="94"></a>infinite. It is then a quantity. For the infinite is in the category of
        <a name="95"></a>quantity, whereas substance or quality or affection cannot be infinite
        <a name="96"></a>except through a concomitant attribute, that is, if at the same time they
        <a name="97"></a>are also quantities. For to define the infinite you must use quantity in
        <a name="98"></a>your formula, but not substance or quality. If then Being is both substance
        <a name="99"></a>and quantity, it is two, not one: if only substance, it is not infinite
        <a name="100"></a>and has no magnitude; for to have that it will have to be a
        <a name="101"></a>quantity.
        <a name="102"></a><br><br>Again, 'one' itself, no less than 'being', is used in many senses,
        <a name="103"></a>so we must consider in what sense the word is used when it is said that
        <a name="104"></a>the All is one.
        <a name="105"></a><br><br>Now we say that (a) the continuous is one or that (b) the indivisible
        <a name="106"></a>is one, or (c) things are said to be 'one', when their essence is one and
        <a name="107"></a>the same, as 'liquor' and 'drink'.
        <a name="108"></a><br><br>If (a) their One is one in the sense of continuous, it is many,
        <a name="109"></a>for the continuous is divisible ad infinitum.
        <a name="110"></a><br><br>There is, indeed, a difficulty about part and whole, perhaps not
        <a name="111"></a>relevant to the present argument, yet deserving consideration on its own
        <a name="112"></a>account-namely, whether the part and the whole are one or more than one,
        <a name="113"></a>and how they can be one or many, and, if they are more than one, in what
        <a name="114"></a>sense they are more than one. (Similarly with the parts of wholes which
        <a name="115"></a>are not continuous.) Further, if each of the two parts is indivisibly one
        <a name="116"></a>with the whole, the difficulty arises that they will be indivisibly one
        <a name="117"></a>with each other also.
        <a name="118"></a><br><br>But to proceed: If (b) their One is one as indivisible, nothing
        <a name="119"></a>will have quantity or quality, and so the one will not be infinite, as
        <a name="120"></a>Melissus says-nor, indeed, limited, as Parmenides says, for though the
        <a name="121"></a>limit is indivisible, the limited is not.
        <a name="122"></a><br><br>But if (c) all things are one in the sense of having the same definition,
        <a name="123"></a>like 'raiment' and 'dress', then it turns out that they are maintaining
        <a name="124"></a>the Heraclitean doctrine, for it will be the same thing 'to be good' and
        <a name="125"></a>'to be bad', and 'to be good' and 'to be not good', and so the same thing
        <a name="126"></a>will be 'good' and 'not good', and man and horse; in fact, their view will
        <a name="127"></a>be, not that all things are one, but that they are nothing; and that 'to
        <a name="128"></a>be of such-and-such a quality' is the same as 'to be of such-and-such a
        <a name="129"></a>size'.
        <a name="130"></a><br><br>Even the more recent of the ancient thinkers were in a pother lest
        <a name="131"></a>the same thing should turn out in their hands both one and many. So some,
        <a name="132"></a>like Lycophron, were led to omit 'is', others to change the mode of expression
        <a name="133"></a>and say 'the man has been whitened' instead of 'is white', and 'walks'
        <a name="134"></a>instead of 'is walking', for fear that if they added the word 'is' they
        <a name="135"></a>should be making the one to be many-as if 'one' and 'being' were always
        <a name="136"></a>used in one and the same sense. What 'is' may be many either in definition
        <a name="137"></a>(for example 'to be white' is one thing, 'to be musical' another, yet the
        <a name="138"></a>same thing be both, so the one is many) or by division, as the whole and
        <a name="139"></a>its parts. On this point, indeed, they were already getting into difficulties
        <a name="140"></a>and admitted that the one was many-as if there was any difficulty about
        <a name="141"></a>the same thing being both one and many, provided that these are not opposites;
        <a name="142"></a>for 'one' may mean either 'potentially one' or 'actually
        <a name="143"></a>one'.
        <br><br>
        <a name="144"></a><b>Part 3</b>

        <a name="145"></a><br><br>If, then, we approach the thesis in this way it seems impossible
        <a name="146"></a>for all things to be one. Further, the arguments they use to prove their
        <a name="147"></a>position are not difficult to expose. For both of them reason contentiously-I
        <a name="148"></a>mean both Melissus and Parmenides. [Their premisses are false and their
        <a name="149"></a>conclusions do not follow. Or rather the argument of Melissus is gross
        <a name="150"></a>and palpable and offers no difficulty at all: admit one ridiculous proposition
        <a name="151"></a>and the rest follows-a simple enough proceeding.] The fallacy of Melissus
        <a name="152"></a>is obvious. For he supposes that the assumption 'what has come into being
        <a name="153"></a>always has a beginning' justifies the assumption 'what has not come into
        <a name="154"></a>being has no beginning'. Then this also is absurd, that in every case there
        <a name="155"></a>should be a beginning of the thing-not of the time and not only in the
        <a name="156"></a>case of coming to be in the full sense but also in the case of coming to
        <a name="157"></a>have a quality-as if change never took place suddenly. Again, does it follow
        <a name="158"></a>that Being, if one, is motionless? Why should it not move, the whole of
        <a name="159"></a>it within itself, as parts of it do which are unities, e.g. this water?
        <a name="160"></a>Again, why is qualitative change impossible? But, further, Being cannot
        <a name="161"></a>be one in form, though it may be in what it is made of. (Even some of the
        <a name="162"></a>physicists hold it to be one in the latter way, though not in the former.)
        <a name="163"></a>Man obviously differs from horse in form, and contraries from each
        <a name="164"></a>other.
        <a name="165"></a><br><br>The same kind of argument holds good against Parmenides also, besides
        <a name="166"></a>any that may apply specially to his view: the answer to him being that
        <a name="167"></a>'this is not true' and 'that does not follow'. His assumption that one
        <a name="168"></a>is used in a single sense only is false, because it is used in several.
        <a name="169"></a>His conclusion does not follow, because if we take only white things, and
        <a name="170"></a>if 'white' has a single meaning, none the less what is white will be many
        <a name="171"></a>and not one. For what is white will not be one either in the sense that
        <a name="172"></a>it is continuous or in the sense that it must be defined in only one way.
        <a name="173"></a>'Whiteness' will be different from 'what has whiteness'. Nor does this
        <a name="174"></a>mean that there is anything that can exist separately, over and above what
        <a name="175"></a>is white. For 'whiteness' and 'that which is white' differ in definition,
        <a name="176"></a>not in the sense that they are things which can exist apart from each other.
        <a name="177"></a>But Parmenides had not come in sight of this distinction.
        <a name="178"></a><br><br>It is necessary for him, then, to assume not only that 'being'
        <a name="179"></a>has the same meaning, of whatever it is predicated, but further that it
        <a name="180"></a>means (1) what just is and (2) what is just one.
        <a name="181"></a><br><br>It must be so, for (1) an attribute is predicated of some subject,
        <a name="182"></a>so that the subject to which 'being' is attributed will not be, as it is
        <a name="183"></a>something different from 'being'. Something, therefore, which is not will
        <a name="184"></a>be. Hence 'substance' will not be a predicate of anything else. For the
        <a name="185"></a>subject cannot be a being, unless 'being' means several things, in such
        <a name="186"></a>a way that each is something. But ex hypothesi 'being' means only one
        <a name="187"></a>thing.
        <a name="188"></a><br><br>If, then, 'substance' is not attributed to anything, but other
        <a name="189"></a>things are attributed to it, how does 'substance' mean what is rather than
        <a name="190"></a>what is not? For suppose that 'substance' is also 'white'. Since the definition
        <a name="191"></a>of the latter is different (for being cannot even be attributed to white,
        <a name="192"></a>as nothing is which is not 'substance'), it follows that 'white' is not-being--and
        <a name="193"></a>that not in the sense of a particular not-being, but in the sense that
        <a name="194"></a>it is not at all. Hence 'substance' is not; for it is true to say that
        <a name="195"></a>it is white, which we found to mean not-being. If to avoid this we say
        <a name="196"></a>that even 'white' means substance, it follows that 'being' has more than
        <a name="197"></a>one meaning.
        <a name="198"></a><br><br>In particular, then, Being will not have magnitude, if it is substance.
        <a name="199"></a>For each of the two parts must he in a different sense.
        <a name="200"></a><br><br>(2) Substance is plainly divisible into other substances, if we
        <a name="201"></a>consider the mere nature of a definition. For instance, if 'man' is a substance,
        <a name="202"></a>'animal' and 'biped' must also be substances. For if not substances, they
        <a name="203"></a>must be attributes-and if attributes, attributes either of (a) man or of
        <a name="204"></a>(b) some other subject. But neither is possible.
        <a name="205"></a><br><br>(a) An attribute is either that which may or may not belong to
        <a name="206"></a>the subject or that in whose definition the subject of which it is an attribute
        <a name="207"></a>is involved. Thus 'sitting' is an example of a separable attribute, while
        <a name="208"></a>'snubness' contains the definition of 'nose', to which we attribute snubness.
        <a name="209"></a>Further, the definition of the whole is not contained in the definitions
        <a name="210"></a>of the contents or elements of the definitory formula; that of 'man' for
        <a name="211"></a>instance in 'biped', or that of 'white man' in 'white'. If then this is
        <a name="212"></a>so, and if 'biped' is supposed to be an attribute of 'man', it must be
        <a name="213"></a>either separable, so that 'man' might possibly not be 'biped', or the definition
        <a name="214"></a>of 'man' must come into the definition of 'biped'-which is impossible,
        <a name="215"></a>as the converse is the case.
        <a name="216"></a><br><br>(b) If, on the other hand, we suppose that 'biped' and 'animal'
        <a name="217"></a>are attributes not of man but of something else, and are not each of them
        <a name="218"></a>a substance, then 'man' too will be an attribute of something else. But
        <a name="219"></a>we must assume that substance is not the attribute of anything, that the
        <a name="220"></a>subject of which both 'biped' and 'animal' and each separately are predicated
        <a name="221"></a>is the subject also of the complex 'biped animal'.
        <a name="222"></a><br><br>Are we then to say that the All is composed of indivisible substances?
        <a name="223"></a>Some thinkers did, in point of fact, give way to both arguments. To the
        <a name="224"></a>argument that all things are one if being means one thing, they conceded
        <a name="225"></a>that not-being is; to that from bisection, they yielded by positing atomic
        <a name="226"></a>magnitudes. But obviously it is not true that if being means one thing,
        <a name="227"></a>and cannot at the same time mean the contradictory of this, there will
        <a name="228"></a>be nothing which is not, for even if what is not cannot be without qualification,
        <a name="229"></a>there is no reason why it should not be a particular not-being. To say
        <a name="230"></a>that all things will be one, if there is nothing besides Being itself,
        <a name="231"></a>is absurd. For who understands 'being itself' to be anything but a particular
        <a name="232"></a>substance? But if this is so, there is nothing to prevent there being many
        <a name="233"></a>beings, as has been said.
        <a name="234"></a><br><br>It is, then, clearly impossible for Being to be one in this
        <a name="235"></a>sense.

        <a name="236"></a><b>Part 4</b>

        <a name="237"></a><br><br>The physicists on the other hand have two modes of
        <a name="238"></a>explanation.
        <a name="239"></a><br>The first set make the underlying body one either one of the three
        <a name="240"></a>or something else which is denser than fire and rarer than air then generate
        <a name="241"></a>everything else from this, and obtain multiplicity by condensation and
        <a name="242"></a>rarefaction. Now these are contraries, which may be generalized into 'excess
        <a name="243"></a>and defect'. (Compare Plato's 'Great and Small'-except that he make these
        <a name="244"></a>his matter, the one his form, while the others treat the one which underlies
        <a name="245"></a>as matter and the contraries as differentiae, i.e. forms).
        <a name="246"></a><br><br>The second set assert that the contrarieties are contained in the
        <a name="247"></a>one and emerge from it by segregation, for example Anaximander and also
        <a name="248"></a>all those who assert that 'what is' is one and many, like Empedocles and
        <a name="249"></a>Anaxagoras; for they too produce other things from their mixture by segregation.
        <a name="250"></a>These differ, however, from each other in that the former imagines a cycle
        <a name="251"></a>of such changes, the latter a single series. Anaxagoras again made both
        <a name="252"></a>his 'homceomerous' substances and his contraries infinite in multitude,
        <a name="253"></a>whereas Empedocles posits only the so-called elements.
        <a name="254"></a><br><br>The theory of Anaxagoras that the principles are infinite in multitude
        <a name="255"></a>was probably due to his acceptance of the common opinion of the physicists
        <a name="256"></a>that nothing comes into being from not-being. For this is the reason why
        <a name="257"></a>they use the phrase 'all things were together' and the coming into being
        <a name="258"></a>of such and such a kind of thing is reduced to change of quality, while
        <a name="259"></a>some spoke of combination and separation. Moreover, the fact that the contraries
        <a name="260"></a>proceed from each other led them to the conclusion. The one, they reasoned,
        <a name="261"></a>must have already existed in the other; for since everything that comes
        <a name="262"></a>into being must arise either from what is or from what is not, and it is
        <a name="263"></a>impossible for it to arise from what is not (on this point all the physicists
        <a name="264"></a>agree), they thought that the truth of the alternative necessarily followed,
        <a name="265"></a>namely that things come into being out of existent things, i.e. out of
        <a name="266"></a>things already present, but imperceptible to our senses because of the
        <a name="267"></a>smallness of their bulk. So they assert that everything has been mixed
        <a name="268"></a>in every. thing, because they saw everything arising out of everything.
        <a name="269"></a>But things, as they say, appear different from one another and receive
        <a name="270"></a>different names according to the nature of the particles which are numerically
        <a name="271"></a>predominant among the innumerable constituents of the mixture. For nothing,
        <a name="272"></a>they say, is purely and entirely white or black or sweet, bone or flesh,
        <a name="273"></a>but the nature of a thing is held to be that of which it contains the
        <a name="274"></a>most.
        <a name="275"></a><br><br>Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is
        <a name="276"></a>infinite in multitude or size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite
        <a name="277"></a>in variety of kind is unknowable in quality. But the principles in question
        <a name="278"></a>are infinite both in multitude and in kind. Therefore it is impossible
        <a name="279"></a>to know things which are composed of them; for it is when we know the nature
        <a name="280"></a>and quantity of its components that we suppose we know a
        <a name="281"></a>complex.
        <a name="282"></a><br><br>Further (2) if the parts of a whole may be of any size in the direction
        <a name="283"></a>either of greatness or of smallness (by 'parts' I mean components into
        <a name="284"></a>which a whole can be divided and which are actually present in it), it
        <a name="285"></a>is necessary that the whole thing itself may be of any size. Clearly, therefore,
        <a name="286"></a>since it is impossible for an animal or plant to be indefinitely big or
        <a name="287"></a>small, neither can its parts be such, or the whole will be the same. But
        <a name="288"></a>flesh, bone, and the like are the parts of animals, and the fruits are
        <a name="289"></a>the parts of plants. Hence it is obvious that neither flesh, bone, nor
        <a name="290"></a>any such thing can be of indefinite size in the direction either of the
        <a name="291"></a>greater or of the less.
        <a name="292"></a><br><br>Again (3) according to the theory all such things are already present
        <a name="293"></a>in one another and do not come into being but are constituents which are
        <a name="294"></a>separated out, and a thing receives its designation from its chief constituent.
        <a name="295"></a>Further, anything may come out of anything-water by segregation from flesh
        <a name="296"></a>and flesh from water. Hence, since every finite body is exhausted by the
        <a name="297"></a>repeated abstraction of a finite body, it seems obviously to follow that
        <a name="298"></a>everything cannot subsist in everything else. For let flesh be extracted
        <a name="299"></a>from water and again more flesh be produced from the remainder by repeating
        <a name="300"></a>the process of separation: then, even though the quantity separated out
        <a name="301"></a>will continually decrease, still it will not fall below a certain magnitude.
        <a name="302"></a>If, therefore, the process comes to an end, everything will not be in everything
        <a name="303"></a>else (for there will be no flesh in the remaining water); if on the other
        <a name="304"></a>hand it does not, and further extraction is always possible, there will
        <a name="305"></a>be an infinite multitude of finite equal particles in a finite quantity-which
        <a name="306"></a>is impossible. Another proof may be added: Since every body must diminish
        <a name="307"></a>in size when something is taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively definite
        <a name="308"></a>in respect both of greatness and smallness, it is clear that from the minimum
        <a name="309"></a>quantity of flesh no body can be separated out; for the flesh left would
        <a name="310"></a>be less than the minimum of flesh.
        <a name="311"></a><br><br>Lastly (4) in each of his infinite bodies there would be already
        <a name="312"></a>present infinite flesh and blood and brain- having a distinct existence,
        <a name="313"></a>however, from one another, and no less real than the infinite bodies, and
        <a name="314"></a>each infinite: which is contrary to reason.
        <a name="315"></a><br><br>The statement that complete separation never will take place is
        <a name="316"></a>correct enough, though Anaxagoras is not fully aware of what it means.
        <a name="317"></a>For affections are indeed inseparable. If then colours and states had entered
        <a name="318"></a>into the mixture, and if separation took place, there would be a 'white'
        <a name="319"></a>or a 'healthy' which was nothing but white or healthy, i.e. was not the
        <a name="320"></a>predicate of a subject. So his 'Mind' is an absurd person aiming at the
        <a name="321"></a>impossible, if he is supposed to wish to separate them, and it is impossible
        <a name="322"></a>to do so, both in respect of quantity and of quality- of quantity, because
        <a name="323"></a>there is no minimum magnitude, and of quality, because affections are
        <a name="324"></a>inseparable.
        <a name="325"></a><br><br>Nor is Anaxagoras right about the coming to be of homogeneous bodies.
        <a name="326"></a>It is true there is a sense in which clay is divided into pieces of clay,
        <a name="327"></a>but there is another in which it is not. Water and air are, and are generated
        <a name="328"></a>'from' each other, but not in the way in which bricks come 'from' a house
        <a name="329"></a>and again a house 'from' bricks; and it is better to assume a smaller and
        <a name="330"></a>finite number of principles, as Empedocles does.
        <br><br>
        <a name="331"></a><b>Part 5</b>

        <a name="332"></a><br><br>All thinkers then agree in making the contraries principles, both
        <a name="333"></a>those who describe the All as one and unmoved (for even Parmenides treats
        <a name="334"></a>hot and cold as principles under the names of fire and earth) and those
        <a name="335"></a>too who use the rare and the dense. The same is true of Democritus also,
        <a name="336"></a>with his plenum and void, both of which exist, be says, the one as being,
        <a name="337"></a>the other as not-being. Again he speaks of differences in position, shape,
        <a name="338"></a>and order, and these are genera of which the species are contraries, namely,
        <a name="339"></a>of position, above and below, before and behind; of shape, angular and
        <a name="340"></a>angle-less, straight and round.
        <a name="341"></a><br><br>It is plain then that they all in one way or another identify the
        <a name="342"></a>contraries with the principles. And with good reason. For first principles
        <a name="343"></a>must not be derived from one another nor from anything else, while everything
        <a name="344"></a>has to be derived from them. But these conditions are fulfilled by the
        <a name="345"></a>primary contraries, which are not derived from anything else because they
        <a name="346"></a>are primary, nor from each other because they are contraries.
        <a name="347"></a><br><br>But we must see how this can be arrived at as a reasoned result,
        <a name="348"></a>as well as in the way just indicated.
        <a name="349"></a><br><br>Our first presupposition must be that in nature nothing acts on,
        <a name="350"></a>or is acted on by, any other thing at random, nor may anything come from
        <a name="351"></a>anything else, unless we mean that it does so in virtue of a concomitant
        <a name="352"></a>attribute. For how could 'white' come from 'musical', unless 'musical'
        <a name="353"></a>happened to be an attribute of the not-white or of the black? No, 'white'
        <a name="354"></a>comes from 'not-white'-and not from any 'not-white', but from black or
        <a name="355"></a>some intermediate colour. Similarly, 'musical' comes to be from 'not-musical',
        <a name="356"></a>but not from any thing other than musical, but from 'unmusical' or any
        <a name="357"></a>intermediate state there may be.
        <a name="358"></a><br><br>Nor again do things pass into the first chance thing; 'white' does
        <a name="359"></a>not pass into 'musical' (except, it may be, in virtue of a concomitant
        <a name="360"></a>attribute), but into 'not-white'-and not into any chance thing which is
        <a name="361"></a>not white, but into black or an intermediate colour; 'musical' passes into
        <a name="362"></a>'not-musical'-and not into any chance thing other than musical, but into
        <a name="363"></a>'unmusical' or any intermediate state there may be.
        <a name="364"></a><br><br>The same holds of other things also: even things which are not
        <a name="365"></a>simple but complex follow the same principle, but the opposite state has
        <a name="366"></a>not received a name, so we fail to notice the fact. What is in tune must
        <a name="367"></a>come from what is not in tune, and vice versa; the tuned passes into untunedness-and
        <a name="368"></a>not into any untunedness, but into the corresponding opposite. It does
        <a name="369"></a>not matter whether we take attunement, order, or composition for our illustration;
        <a name="370"></a>the principle is obviously the same in all, and in fact applies equally
        <a name="371"></a>to the production of a house, a statue, or any other complex. A house comes
        <a name="372"></a>from certain things in a certain state of separation instead of conjunction,
        <a name="373"></a>a statue (or any other thing that has been shaped) from shapelessness-each
        <a name="374"></a>of these objects being partly order and partly composition.
        <a name="375"></a><br><br>If then this is true, everything that comes to be or passes away
        <a name="376"></a>from, or passes into, its contrary or an intermediate state. But the intermediates
        <a name="377"></a>are derived from the contraries-colours, for instance, from black and white.
        <a name="378"></a>Everything, therefore, that comes to be by a natural process is either
        <a name="379"></a>a contrary or a product of contraries.
        <a name="380"></a><br><br>Up to this point we have practically had most of the other writers
        <a name="381"></a>on the subject with us, as I have said already: for all of them identify
        <a name="382"></a>their elements, and what they call their principles, with the contraries,
        <a name="383"></a>giving no reason indeed for the theory, but contrained as it were by the
        <a name="384"></a>truth itself. They differ, however, from one another in that some assume
        <a name="385"></a>contraries which are more primary, others contraries which are less so:
        <a name="386"></a>some those more knowable in the order of explanation, others those more
        <a name="387"></a>familiar to sense. For some make hot and cold, or again moist and dry,
        <a name="388"></a>the conditions of becoming; while others make odd and even, or again Love
        <a name="389"></a>and Strife; and these differ from each other in the way
        <a name="390"></a>mentioned.
        <a name="391"></a><br><br>Hence their principles are in one sense the same, in another different;
        <a name="392"></a>different certainly, as indeed most people think, but the same inasmuch
        <a name="393"></a>as they are analogous; for all are taken from the same table of columns,
        <a name="394"></a>some of the pairs being wider, others narrower in extent. In this way then
        <a name="395"></a>their theories are both the same and different, some better, some worse;
        <a name="396"></a>some, as I have said, take as their contraries what is more knowable in
        <a name="397"></a>the order of explanation, others what is more familiar to sense. (The universal
        <a name="398"></a>is more knowable in the order of explanation, the particular in the order
        <a name="399"></a>of sense: for explanation has to do with the universal, sense with the
        <a name="400"></a>particular.) 'The great and the small', for example, belong to the former
        <a name="401"></a>class, 'the dense and the rare' to the latter.
        <a name="402"></a><br><br>It is clear then that our principles must be
        <a name="403"></a>contraries.
        <br><br>
        <a name="404"></a><b>Part 6</b>

        <a name="405"></a><br><br>The next question is whether the principles are two or three or
        <a name="406"></a>more in number.
        <a name="407"></a><br><br>One they cannot be, for there cannot be one contrary. Nor can they
        <a name="408"></a>be innumerable, because, if so, Being will not be knowable: and in any
        <a name="409"></a>one genus there is only one contrariety, and substance is one genus: also
        <a name="410"></a>a finite number is sufficient, and a finite number, such as the principles
        <a name="411"></a>of Empedocles, is better than an infinite multitude; for Empedocles professes
        <a name="412"></a>to obtain from his principles all that Anaxagoras obtains from his innumerable
        <a name="413"></a>principles. Lastly, some contraries are more primary than others, and some
        <a name="414"></a>arise from others-for example sweet and bitter, white and black-whereas
        <a name="415"></a>the principles must always remain principles.
        <a name="416"></a><br><br>This will suffice to show that the principles are neither one nor
        <a name="417"></a>innumerable.
        <a name="418"></a><br><br>Granted, then, that they are a limited number, it is plausible
        <a name="419"></a>to suppose them more than two. For it is difficult to see how either density
        <a name="420"></a>should be of such a nature as to act in any way on rarity or rarity on
        <a name="421"></a>density. The same is true of any other pair of contraries; for Love does
        <a name="422"></a>not gather Strife together and make things out of it, nor does Strife make
        <a name="423"></a>anything out of Love, but both act on a third thing different from both.
        <a name="424"></a>Some indeed assume more than one such thing from which they construct the
        <a name="425"></a>world of nature.
        <a name="426"></a><br><br>Other objections to the view that it is not necessary to assume
        <a name="427"></a>a third principle as a substratum may be added. (1) We do not find that
        <a name="428"></a>the contraries constitute the substance of any thing. But what is a first
        <a name="429"></a>principle ought not to be the predicate of any subject. If it were, there
        <a name="430"></a>would be a principle of the supposed principle: for the subject is a principle,
        <a name="431"></a>and prior presumably to what is predicated of it. Again (2) we hold that
        <a name="432"></a>a substance is not contrary to another substance. How then can substance
        <a name="433"></a>be derived from what are not substances? Or how can non-substances be prior
        <a name="434"></a>to substance?
        <a name="435"></a><br><br>If then we accept both the former argument and this one, we must,
        <a name="436"></a>to preserve both, assume a third somewhat as the substratum of the contraries,
        <a name="437"></a>such as is spoken of by those who describe the All as one nature-water
        <a name="438"></a>or fire or what is intermediate between them. What is intermediate seems
        <a name="439"></a>preferable; for fire, earth, air, and water are already involved with pairs
        <a name="440"></a>of contraries. There is, therefore, much to be said for those who make
        <a name="441"></a>the underlying substance different from these four; of the rest, the next
        <a name="442"></a>best choice is air, as presenting sensible differences in a less degree
        <a name="443"></a>than the others; and after air, water. All, however, agree in this, that
        <a name="444"></a>they differentiate their One by means of the contraries, such as density
        <a name="445"></a>and rarity and more and less, which may of course be generalized, as has
        <a name="446"></a>already been said into excess and defect. Indeed this doctrine too (that
        <a name="447"></a>the One and excess and defect are the principles of things) would appear
        <a name="448"></a>to be of old standing, though in different forms; for the early thinkers
        <a name="449"></a>made the two the active and the one the passive principle, whereas some
        <a name="450"></a>of the more recent maintain the reverse.
        <a name="451"></a><br><br>To suppose then that the elements are three in number would seem,
        <a name="452"></a>from these and similar considerations, a plausible view, as I said before.
        <a name="453"></a>On the other hand, the view that they are more than three in number would
        <a name="454"></a>seem to be untenable.
        <a name="455"></a><br><br>For the one substratum is sufficient to be acted on; but if we
        <a name="456"></a>have four contraries, there will be two contrarieties, and we shall have
        <a name="457"></a>to suppose an intermediate nature for each pair separately. If, on the
        <a name="458"></a>other hand, the contrarieties, being two, can generate from each other,
        <a name="459"></a>the second contrariety will be superfluous. Moreover, it is impossible
        <a name="460"></a>that there should be more than one primary contrariety. For substance is
        <a name="461"></a>a single genus of being, so that the principles can differ only as prior
        <a name="462"></a>and posterior, not in genus; in a single genus there is always a single
        <a name="463"></a>contrariety, all the other contrarieties in it being held to be reducible
        <a name="464"></a>to one.
        <a name="465"></a><br><br>It is clear then that the number of elements is neither one nor
        <a name="466"></a>more than two or three; but whether two or three is, as I said, a question
        <a name="467"></a>of considerable difficulty.
        <br><br>
        <a name="468"></a><b>Part 7</b>

        <a name="469"></a><br><br>We will now give our own account, approaching the question first
        <a name="470"></a>with reference to becoming in its widest sense: for we shall be following
        <a name="471"></a>the natural order of inquiry if we speak first of common characteristics,
        <a name="472"></a>and then investigate the characteristics of special
        <a name="473"></a>cases.
        <a name="474"></a><br><br>We say that one thing comes to be from another thing, and one sort
        <a name="475"></a>of thing from another sort of thing, both in the case of simple and of
        <a name="476"></a>complex things. I mean the following. We can say (1) 'man becomes musical',
        <a name="477"></a>(2) what is 'not-musical becomes musical', or (3), the 'not-musical man
        <a name="478"></a>becomes a musical man'. Now what becomes in (1) and (2)-'man' and 'not
        <a name="479"></a>musical'-I call simple, and what each becomes-'musical'-simple also. But
        <a name="480"></a>when (3) we say the 'not-musical man becomes a musical man', both what
        <a name="481"></a>becomes and what it becomes are complex.
        <a name="482"></a><br><br>As regards one of these simple 'things that become' we say not
        <a name="483"></a>only 'this becomes so-and-so', but also 'from being this, comes to be so-and-so',
        <a name="484"></a>as 'from being not-musical comes to be musical'; as regards the other we
        <a name="485"></a>do not say this in all cases, as we do not say (1) 'from being a man he
        <a name="486"></a>came to be musical' but only 'the man became musical'.
        <a name="487"></a><br><br>When a 'simple' thing is said to become something, in one case
        <a name="488"></a>(1) it survives through the process, in the other (2) it does not. For
        <a name="489"></a>man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what
        <a name="490"></a>is not musical or is unmusical does not continue to exist, either simply
        <a name="491"></a>or combined with the subject.
        <a name="492"></a><br><br>These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various
        <a name="493"></a>cases of becoming in the way we are describing that, as we say, there must
        <a name="494"></a>always be an underlying something, namely that which becomes, and that
        <a name="495"></a>this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By that
        <a name="496"></a>I mean that it can be described in different ways.) For 'to be man' is
        <a name="497"></a>not the same as 'to be unmusical'. One part survives, the other does not:
        <a name="498"></a>what is not an opposite survives (for 'man' survives), but 'not-musical'
        <a name="499"></a>or 'unmusical' does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely
        <a name="500"></a>'unmusical man'.
        <a name="501"></a><br><br>We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming
        <a name="502"></a>that' more in the case of what does not survive the change-'becoming musical
        <a name="503"></a>from unmusical', not 'from man'-but there are exceptions, as we sometimes
        <a name="504"></a>use the latter form of expression even of what survives; we speak of 'a
        <a name="505"></a>statue coming to be from bronze', not of the 'bronze becoming a statue'.
        <a name="506"></a>The change, however, from an opposite which does not survive is described
        <a name="507"></a>indifferently in both ways, 'becoming that from this' or 'this becoming
        <a name="508"></a>that'. We say both that 'the unmusical becomes musical', and that 'from
        <a name="509"></a>unmusical he becomes musical'. And so both forms are used of the complex,
        <a name="510"></a>'becoming a musical man from an unmusical man', and unmusical man becoming
        <a name="511"></a>a musical man'.
        <a name="512"></a><br><br>But there are different senses of 'coming to be'. In some cases
        <a name="513"></a>we do not use the expression 'come to be', but 'come to be so-and-so'.
        <a name="514"></a>Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified
        <a name="515"></a>sense.
        <a name="516"></a><br><br>Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must
        <a name="517"></a>be some subject, namely, that which becomes. For we know that when a thing
        <a name="518"></a>comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time,
        <a name="519"></a>or place, a subject is always presupposed, since substance alone is not
        <a name="520"></a>predicated of another subject, but everything else of
        <a name="521"></a>substance.
        <a name="522"></a><br><br>But that substances too, and anything else that can be said 'to
        <a name="523"></a>be' without qualification, come to be from some substratum, will appear
        <a name="524"></a>on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from
        <a name="525"></a>which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants
        <a name="526"></a>from seed.
        <a name="527"></a><br><br>Generally things which come to be, come to be in different ways:
        <a name="528"></a>(1) by change of shape, as a statue; (2) by addition, as things which grow;
        <a name="529"></a>(3) by taking away, as the Hermes from the stone; (4) by putting together,
        <a name="530"></a>as a house; (5) by alteration, as things which 'turn' in respect of their
        <a name="531"></a>material substance.
        <a name="532"></a><br><br>It is plain that these are all cases of coming to be from a
        <a name="533"></a>substratum.
        <a name="534"></a><br><br>Thus, clearly, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is
        <a name="535"></a>always complex. There is, on the one hand, (a) something which comes into
        <a name="536"></a>existence, and again (b) something which becomes that-the latter (b) in
        <a name="537"></a>two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the 'opposite' I mean
        <a name="538"></a>the 'unmusical', by the 'subject' 'man', and similarly I call the absence
        <a name="539"></a>of shape or form or order the 'opposite', and the bronze or stone or gold
        <a name="540"></a>the 'subject'.
        <a name="541"></a><br><br>Plainly then, if there are conditions and principles which constitute
        <a name="542"></a>natural objects and from which they primarily are or have come to be-have
        <a name="543"></a>come to be, I mean, what each is said to be in its essential nature, not
        <a name="544"></a>what each is in respect of a concomitant attribute-plainly, I say, everything
        <a name="545"></a>comes to be from both subject and form. For 'musical man' is composed (in
        <a name="546"></a>a way) of 'man' and 'musical': you can analyse it into the definitions
        <a name="547"></a>of its elements. It is clear then that what comes to be will come to be
        <a name="548"></a>from these elements.
        <a name="549"></a><br><br>Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For
        <a name="550"></a>it is the man, the gold-the 'matter' generally-that is counted, for it
        <a name="551"></a>is more of the nature of a 'this', and what comes to be does not come from
        <a name="552"></a>it in virtue of a concomitant attribute; the privation, on the other hand,
        <a name="553"></a>and the contrary are incidental in the process.) And the positive form
        <a name="554"></a>is one-the order, the acquired art of music, or any similar
        <a name="555"></a>predicate.
        <a name="556"></a><br><br>There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles
        <a name="557"></a>to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries
        <a name="558"></a>are the principles-say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot
        <a name="559"></a>and the cold, the tuned and the untuned-and a sense in which they are not,
        <a name="560"></a>since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other.
        <a name="561"></a>But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that the substratum is different
        <a name="562"></a>from the contraries, for it is itself not a contrary. The principles therefore
        <a name="563"></a>are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two,
        <a name="564"></a>nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of essential nature,
        <a name="565"></a>but three. For 'to be man' is different from 'to be unmusical', and 'to
        <a name="566"></a>be unformed' from 'to be bronze'.
        <a name="567"></a><br><br>We have now stated the number of the principles of natural objects
        <a name="568"></a>which are subject to generation, and how the number is reached: and it
        <a name="569"></a>is clear that there must be a substratum for the contraries, and that the
        <a name="570"></a>contraries must be two. (Yet in another way of putting it this is not necessary,
        <a name="571"></a>as one of the contraries will serve to effect the change by its successive
        <a name="572"></a>absence and presence.)
        <a name="573"></a><br><br>The underlying nature is an object of scientific knowledge, by
        <a name="574"></a>an analogy. For as the bronze is to the statue, the wood to the bed, or
        <a name="575"></a>the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has
        <a name="576"></a>form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the 'this' or
        <a name="577"></a>existent.
        <a name="578"></a><br><br>This then is one principle (though not one or existent in the same
        <a name="579"></a>sense as the 'this'), and the definition was one as we agreed; then further
        <a name="580"></a>there is its contrary, the privation. In what sense these are two, and
        <a name="581"></a>in what sense more, has been stated above. Briefly, we explained first
        <a name="582"></a>that only the contraries were principles, and later that a substratum was
        <a name="583"></a>indispensable, and that the principles were three; our last statement has
        <a name="584"></a>elucidated the difference between the contraries, the mutual relation of
        <a name="585"></a>the principles, and the nature of the substratum. Whether the form or the
        <a name="586"></a>substratum is the essential nature of a physical object is not yet clear.
        <a name="587"></a>But that the principles are three, and in what sense, and the way in which
        <a name="588"></a>each is a principle, is clear.
        <a name="589"></a><br><br>So much then for the question of the number and the nature of the
        <a name="590"></a>principles.
        <br><br>
        <a name="591"></a><b>Part 8</b>

        <a name="592"></a><br><br>We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early thinkers,
        <a name="593"></a>as well as our own, is solved in this way alone.
        <a name="594"></a><br><br>The first of those who studied science were misled in their search
        <a name="595"></a>for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were
        <a name="596"></a>thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the things that
        <a name="597"></a>are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to
        <a name="598"></a>be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are
        <a name="599"></a>impossible. For what is cannot come to be (because it is already), and
        <a name="600"></a>from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must
        <a name="601"></a>be present as a substratum). So too they exaggerated the consequence of
        <a name="602"></a>this, and went so far as to deny even the existence of a plurality of things,
        <a name="603"></a>maintaining that only Being itself is. Such then was their opinion, and
        <a name="604"></a>such the reason for its adoption.
        <a name="605"></a><br><br>Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something
        <a name="606"></a>comes to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or what is
        <a name="607"></a>does something or has something done to it or becomes some particular thing',
        <a name="608"></a>are to be taken (in the first way of putting our explanation) in the same
        <a name="609"></a>sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him', 'is or
        <a name="610"></a>becomes something from being a doctor.' These expressions may be taken
        <a name="611"></a>in two senses, and so too, clearly, may 'from being', and 'being acts or
        <a name="612"></a>is acted on'. A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder,
        <a name="613"></a>and turns gray, not qua doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand
        <a name="614"></a>he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately
        <a name="615"></a>when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes
        <a name="616"></a>something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor.
        <a name="617"></a>Clearly then also 'to come to be so-and-so from not-being' means 'qua
        <a name="618"></a>not-being'.
        <a name="619"></a><br><br>It was through failure to make this distinction that those thinkers
        <a name="620"></a>gave the matter up, and through this error that they went so much farther
        <a name="621"></a>astray as to suppose that nothing else comes to be or exists apart from
        <a name="622"></a>Being itself, thus doing away with all becoming.
        <a name="623"></a><br><br>We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing
        <a name="624"></a>can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless
        <a name="625"></a>we maintain that a thing may 'come to be from what is not'-that is, in
        <a name="626"></a>a qualified sense. For a thing comes to be from the privation, which in
        <a name="627"></a>its own nature is not-being,-this not surviving as a constituent of the
        <a name="628"></a>result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something
        <a name="629"></a>should come to be in the way described from what is
        <a name="630"></a>not.
        <a name="631"></a><br><br>In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from being,
        <a name="632"></a>and that being does not come to be except in a qualified sense. In that
        <a name="633"></a>way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and
        <a name="634"></a>an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose
        <a name="635"></a>a dog to come to be from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come
        <a name="636"></a>to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not
        <a name="637"></a>as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal,
        <a name="638"></a>not in a qualified sense, it will not be from animal: and if being, not
        <a name="639"></a>from being-nor from not-being either, for it has been explained that by
        <a name="640"></a>'from not being' we mean from not-being qua not-being.
        <a name="641"></a><br><br>Note further that we do not subvert the principle that everything
        <a name="642"></a>either is or is not.
        <a name="643"></a><br><br>This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists
        <a name="644"></a>in pointing out that the same things can be explained in terms of potentiality
        <a name="645"></a>and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.
        <a name="646"></a>So, as we said, the difficulties which constrain people to deny the existence
        <a name="647"></a>of some of the things we mentioned are now solved. For it was this reason
        <a name="648"></a>which also caused some of the earlier thinkers to turn so far aside from
        <a name="649"></a>the road which leads to coming to be and passing away and change generally.
        <a name="650"></a>If they had come in sight of this nature, all their ignorance would have
        <a name="651"></a>been dispelled.
        <br><br>
        <a name="652"></a><b>Part 9</b>

        <a name="653"></a><br><br>Others, indeed, have apprehended the nature in question, but not
        <a name="654"></a>adequately.
        <a name="655"></a><br><br>In the first place they allow that a thing may come to be without
        <a name="656"></a>qualification from not being, accepting on this point the statement of
        <a name="657"></a>Parmenides. Secondly, they think that if the substratum is one numerically,
        <a name="658"></a>it must have also only a single potentiality-which is a very different
        <a name="659"></a>thing.
        <a name="660"></a><br><br>Now we distinguish matter and privation, and hold that one of these,
        <a name="661"></a>namely the matter, is not-being only in virtue of an attribute which it
        <a name="662"></a>has, while the privation in its own nature is not-being; and that the matter
        <a name="663"></a>is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation in no sense is.
        <a name="664"></a>They, on the other hand, identify their Great and Small alike with not
        <a name="665"></a>being, and that whether they are taken together as one or separately. Their
        <a name="666"></a>triad is therefore of quite a different kind from ours. For they got so
        <a name="667"></a>far as to see that there must be some underlying nature, but they make
        <a name="668"></a>it one-for even if one philosopher makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great
        <a name="669"></a>and Small, the effect is the same, for he overlooked the other nature.
        <a name="670"></a>For the one which persists is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes
        <a name="671"></a>to be-a mother, as it were. But the negative part of the contrariety may
        <a name="672"></a>often seem, if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not
        <a name="673"></a>to exist at all.
        <a name="674"></a><br><br>For admitting with them that there is something divine, good, and
        <a name="675"></a>desirable, we hold that there are two other principles, the one contrary
        <a name="676"></a>to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for it.
        <a name="677"></a>But the consequence of their view is that the contrary desires its wtextinction.
        <a name="678"></a>Yet the form cannot desire itself, for it is not defective; nor can the
        <a name="679"></a>contrary desire it, for contraries are mutually destructive. The truth
        <a name="680"></a>is that what desires the form is matter, as the female desires the male
        <a name="681"></a>and the ugly the beautiful-only the ugly or the female not per se but per
        <a name="682"></a>accidens.
        <a name="683"></a><br><br>The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in
        <a name="684"></a>another it does not. As that which contains the privation, it ceases to
        <a name="685"></a>be in its own nature, for what ceases to be-the privation-is contained
        <a name="686"></a>within it. But as potentiality it does not cease to be in its own nature,
        <a name="687"></a>but is necessarily outside the sphere of becoming and ceasing to be. For
        <a name="688"></a>if it came to be, something must have existed as a primary substratum from
        <a name="689"></a>which it should come and which should persist in it; but this is its own
        <a name="690"></a>special nature, so that it will be before coming to be. (For my definition
        <a name="691"></a>of matter is just this-the primary substratum of each thing, from which
        <a name="692"></a>it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result.)
        <a name="693"></a>And if it ceases to be it will pass into that at the last, so it will have
        <a name="694"></a>ceased to be before ceasing to be.
        <a name="695"></a><br><br>The accurate determination of the first principle in respect of
        <a name="696"></a>form, whether it is one or many and what it is or what they are, is the
        <a name="697"></a>province of the primary type of science; so these questions may stand over
        <a name="698"></a>till then. But of the natural, i.e. perishable, forms we shall speak in
        <a name="699"></a>the expositions which follow.
        <a name="700"></a><br><br>The above, then, may be taken as sufficient to establish that there
        <a name="701"></a>are principles and what they are and how many there are. Now let us make
        <a name="702"></a>a fresh start and proceed.
